# Testing Project - React/TypeScript Web App

## Definition

This is a testing project created using React + React-Redux + Reactive Programming.

## The background

This project permits to a Hospital manager to list patients assigned to a practitioner (using a practitioner ID) and when selecting each patient, it shows a graph using the glucose measures uploaded.

It is compounded by 3 sections: home, a patient’s list and a glucose chart.

### Home
This should contain a component that will allow the practitioner to input his/her user id and if the user id is valid it should navigate to the list section and show the results, otherwise it should show a message saying that the user id is not valid.

### List
This section shows the results of all the patients assigned to that practitioner, showing a scrollable list (if it is needed) and the name, DoB, the diabetes type and a button to navigate to the graph section

### Glucose Measure Chart
Using the data for each patient a graph showing the evolution of a single day is generated using the ‘glucoseMeasures’ (GM), the graphic is created dynamically using the ‘ranges’ value for each patient. 
Each glucose measure is be represented by a cross and on roll over should show the data for that GM and it uses a different color depending on its level.
